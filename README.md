## Bingo v1.1.1:
Re-balanced the CoH v1.1.1 changes and modified/added some goals:

* Modified goals:
    * Easy:
        * Din's Fire -> Clarified to just be Cadence Cave 2 ability
        * Touch the Bench -> Clarified that any scenic bench will work, not just "the" bench since it might not spawn.
        * Rings in the open -> combined into 1 goal and reduced back down to only the ones at fountains (the desert generator one requires no extra work to grab, even though it messes with some bomb jump skips).
    * Medium:
        * Clarified Dark Stairs minibosses
    * Challenge:
        * Re-enabled Skip Nayru's, changed it to Skip R-ability

    * Challenge:
