      This is a bingo card for Cadence of Hyrule, based off of 
      <a href="https://github.com/RattataJack/cadenceBingo">RattataJack's Cadence of Hyrule Bingo Generator</a>, which is based off 
      of Hyphen-ated's <a href="https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/isaacBingo" id=isaacLink>isaacBingo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>You can use this Bingo Generator to achieve what RattataJack's did by selecting 
      "Easy-Medium-Hard magic square, CoH v1.0.2 goal list" from the Goal Lists dropdown.</p>
    <p>You can reset and do multiple runs, but in order to check off a square you have to finish 
      that goal during a single run. All runs must be done on the same seed.</p>
    <p>In the standard difficulty pattern, the center square is always a challenge or restriction. 
      You may mark the square at the start, but if you ever fail the challenge, you must unmark it.</p>
    <p>For goals involving obtaining an item or number of items, you do not need to 
      keep the item(s) after the goal is complete.</p>
    <p>Hovering over a goal may provide additional information.</p>
    <p>The board is still a work in progress.  Feel free to send questions, concerns, 
      and suggestions to Kailaria on the Crypt of the NecroDancer Discord.</p>
